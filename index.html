                        <img class="img-fluid" src="photos/ironman.jpg" alt="Picture of Iron Man from the Marvel Comics Universe flying">
                        <p class="lead">I was first introduced to this character through the original Iron Man show. Then, I saw both Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2, and I have been a fan of the character ever since. Iron Man is a genius that created his own suit of armour to help fight against threats. He is someone not to be messed with as he has defeated many powerful people, including the Hulk. He can put up a fight with anyone, as he will create a suit that is specified against a specific foe. In the movies, he is played by Robert Downey Jr., and I think he did a fantastic job as Tony Stark.</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="photos/moonknight.jpg" alt="Picture of Moon Knight from the Marvel Comics Universe looking over the city from the rooftops">
                        <p class="lead">Moon Knight is honestly one of the coolest characters ever created from the marvel universe. He is a former mercenary that was resurrected by the ancient Moon God named Khonshu, and now he uses his powers to fight crime. Moon Knight is also a very realistic person that suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), and that was one of the reasons I was intrigued by him. His live action actor is Oscar Isaac</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="photos/wolverine.jpg" alt="Picture of Wolverine from the Marvel Comics Universe looking very angry with claws out">
                        <p class="lead">Wolverine is a childhood favorite. He is a mutant superhero that is apart of a mutant team known as the X-Men. His costume is amazing and so are his powers. I first discovered him in the 90s X-Men TV show and he has been one my favorites ever since. There was a point where I would only watch X-Men to see him because he is usually portrayed as the main character, as he is actually the second most popular character in the Marvel universe. He is mainly played by Hugh Jackman in the live action X-Men movies.</p>

                        <h2>Number 2: Batman</h2>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="photos/batman.jpg" alt="Picture of Batman from the DC Comics Universe in the shadows looking menacing">
                        <p class="lead">Batman is easily the most popular character in the DC universe. I remember watching the 90s Batman show, voiced by Kevin Conroy, and it is still one of my favorite shows ever made. Batman is a billionare that became an orphan when his parents were killed in an alley, and ever since he has taken the mantle to protect Gotham City from crime that occurs there. He does this to make his family proud. What I like about him is that is just a normal human that risks his life to do all the dirty work in Gotham, and he has morals with a no-killing rule. It makes him stand out as it is a huge part of his story. He has had many live action actors with Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck, but he is currently played by Robert Pattinson. </p>

                        <h2>Number 1: Spider-Man</h2>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="photos/spiderman.jpg" alt="Picture of Spider-Man from the Marvel Comics Universe climbing up a building">
                        <p class="lead">Of course at number one is Spider-Man himself. He was bitten by a radioactive spider that gave him the powers of a spider. He is the most popular character in the Marvel universe, and there can be an argument that he is the greatest superhero created. One of the reasons he is so popular is that he is the most relatable. He is not a rich man that has his own company, as he starts out as a high school student who goes through the same problems as we do. Even when he does something good, it always comes with a consequence, and that is why so many people gravitate towards him. I first discovered him through his 90s shows, and my parents always got me things based on Spider-Man, whether it was toys or clothes. My favorite Spider-Man show is The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008). In the live action movies, he has been played by Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland.</p>
